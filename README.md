An automated parking system using reinforcement learning. By creating a realistic 3D simulation environment in Unity and utilizing ML agents, a car agent is trained to park autonomously. The agent learns optimal parking strategies through trial and error, receiving rewards for successful maneuvers and penalties for mistakes. 
This system demonstrates the potential of machine learning in enhancing autonomous vehicle capabilities for safer and more efficient parking.
